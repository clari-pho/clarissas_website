          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p> My name is Clarissa Pholeuanghong. I know, I know..youre probably thinking, "wow thats a long last name!"
            I've heard it plenty of times. My last name is of Laotian origin. My father is from 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos" target="_blank">Laos</a> 
            and my mother is from Mexican descent. I'm 33 and was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I am an introvert 100%. I live with my boyfriend Josh and our two cats and dog, Lizzy, Chucky, and Ariel.
            After graduating highschool, I joined the Air Force for 4 years as a Medic. I am very proud that I was able to 
            graduate Basic Training as it was vigorous and challenging. I have been fortunate 
            to travel to Japan and live there a couple of years.
            I would say I'm a pretty big Harry Potter fan. <span style="color:yellow;"><strong>Hufflepuff all the way!</strong></span> I love all things related to the Wizarding World.
            Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/tweet_y14/" target="_blank">link to my Twitter</a> if you wish to connect and tell me which wizarding house you're in.

          <h3>Developer Journey Blog</h3>
          <p>My journey in web developing began in high school and it's where I built my very first web page. But that was years ago and it feels like I'm 
            learning it all over again. It seems more challenging now than it did years ago but its satisfying to challenge myself by continuing my education 
            and learning new skills. Thats what I like about the tech industry, there's always something new to learn. I have learned so much in my software development 
            class and I'm only three weeks in. There is still so much to learn and I am enjoying the ride! So far we have learned basic, intermediate, and advanced HTML and 
            CSS. This past week we just learned some Bootstrap which I find to be interesting and I'm looking to explore it a bit further since it seems like it could be a 
            useful tool. I understand that we will also be learning Java and I am looking forward to learning more on the subject as I do have a small bit of knowledge on it.
